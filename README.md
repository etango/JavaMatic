# JavaMatic

Problem Description:
Your task is to create a simulator of an automatic coffee dispensing machine, called the JavaMatic.
The machine maintains an inventory of drink ingredients, and is able to dispense a fixed set of possible drinks by combining these ingredients in different amounts. The cost of a drink is computed as the total cost of its component ingredients.
Upon startup, the JavaMatic should display its current inventory, followed by a menu to allow the user to select a drink. As drinks are dispensed, the inventory of ingredients should be maintained, to continually and accurately reflect current stock in the machine. Only drinks for which there is sufficient inventory can be dispensed.
